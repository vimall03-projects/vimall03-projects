# Welcome to My Side Account! 🛠️

Hey there! 👋 You've stumbled upon my **side account**, where I tinker with small projects, experiments, and anything that doesn’t make it to the big leagues (i.e., my main account). This is where I try out new things, learn, and maybe break stuff—who knows?

So, if you're expecting cutting-edge, polished, world-changing code, you might want to check out my [main account](https://github.com/vimall03). Here, it's more about the fun, the hustle, and the occasional "oops, what did I do?" moments.

## What to Expect Here:
- **Tiny projects**: Small but mighty. You might find a few gems hidden between the bugs. 😉
- **Random experiments**: The playground where I test stuff before it’s ready for prime time.
- **Side hustle code**: You know, the kind that keeps me busy when I’m not busy with… other things. 😅
  
Feel free to take a look, contribute, or just leave a star! ⭐ Because who doesn't love stars?

Thanks for visiting and may your pull requests be bug-free! (Or not, that's what this account is for, right?)
